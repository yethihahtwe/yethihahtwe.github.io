# Starting Point
Current application version is v2.0. A lot of modifications have taken place since the launch of the application in April 2022. The application is initially capable to run only in Android and now it can be accessed through a web browser from any devices connected to the internet. The major achievement is the responsiveness of the application and same interface fits in the mobile phone, tablet and computer screens. The offline capabilities are the essential features of the application, which is able to collect the data even if the device is offline and automatically sync the server once there is an internet connection. The web browser version of the app can also be installed as a Progressive Web App (PWA) making the app accessible directly from the home screen or the Desktop window where the app still functions even if the device loses the internet connection.
>A Progressive Web App (PWA) is not a native app but can be executed without a browser by opening the app icon on the home screen/desktop of the device. Although PWA is a web application, there is no need to open the web browser and type in the entire web address.
