# Abstract
## Logistic Management Information System (LMIS)
Warehouses on the Thailand-Burma border are working with minimal resources. The major goal of these warehouses is to store supplies and deliver on time to the necessary places in conflict regions of Burma. The Thai government authorities have not given official permission to cross the border from Thailand and bring medicine and related products into Burma. Funds allocated to the warehouses are mostly used for security and transportation rather than establishing a solid infrastructure and a properly managed system. And vice versa, inventory and logistic information of warehouses along the border has not been gathered with an organized system. EHSSG's focus has been shifted to establish an __Inventory and Logistic Management System__ not with the papers but  through a network.

Instead of buying a commercial ```Logistic Management Information System```(LMIS) with tons of extra features not in need at an expensive price, EHSSG chose to build a customized LMIS from scratch that matches the ground conditions of warehouses along the border. The entire ```Logistic Management Information System (LMIS)``` is going to be a cloud based installation which can be accessed through a web browser. Any devices with internet access will be able to login to the LMIS regardless of the screen sizes (Desktop, Laptop, Tablet or phone) and it is going to be platform independent. Devices with any Operating System (Windows, MacOS, ChromeOS, Linux, Android, iOS) will be able to access the cloud based system. Computer systems and internet access points will be installed in established warehouses, and those that do not yet have a fixed location will be assisted to use mobile devices.

## Online Classroom
EHSSG has already created an online classroom in ```https://ehssg.org/school/```.
The classroom uses the ```Moodle``` Learning Management System (LMS) installed in EHSSG's web hosting. The first course of the online classroom is ```First Aid Care Training for Conflict Related Injuries``` which is still under developement process. The major training materials of the course are videos which are 7 minutes to 10 minutes in average length.

Creating the videos basically needs ``scripting``, ``storyboarding``, ``audio recording``, ``video recording``, ``audio editing``, ``video editing``, ``animation``, ``joing audio-video-animation``, ``captioning`` and ``final cut``. The FACT course has finished its ``scripting``, ``storyboarding``, ``audio recording`` and ``video recording`` stages. The most time consuming stage of the process is audio editing, video editing and animation stages. In first week of September 2022, final cut videos for Chapter 3 out of 8 are realeased. The course contains 8 chapters and each chapter usually consists of 5 to 6 videos.

Once final cut videos are exported, the videos are uploaded to YouTube with ```Unlisted``` privacy option. When videos are hosted on YouTube with ```Unlisted``` privacy, the viewers with the link to the video can only access it. Any other users who enter the EHSSG's YouTube channel will not see any ```Unlisted``` videos. Videos are hosted on YouTube as YouTube offers chapters to be divided in a video from timestamps. Once a subtitle in English is attached to the video, automatic subtitle translation to other languages can be obtained as well. Videos hosted on YouTube are embedded in the pages of the online course reducing tons of storage space and traffic bandwidth to the EHSSG web hosting service [^1].

Each module of the course has a viewer restriction option which limits the user from viewing a particular sequel of the study material before viewing the initial foundation material. For example, module-2 of the course is not accessible unless the student has completed module-1.

_Image:Future modules are locked before completing first module_

Each Chapter usually starts with a **Pre-test** quiz which either consists of True/False or Multiple Choice Questions and ends with the same **Post-test** quiz. Though the **Pre-test** doesn't provide grades, the **Post-test** does grading on the students' performance.

# 1.0 Introduction

## 1.1 Oracle Application Express (APEX)

<img src="images/apex.png" style="zoom: 25%;" />
_Image:An Oracle APEX application_

According to [apex.oracle.com](apex.oracle.com), ```Oracle Application Express``` (APEX) is a low-code development platform that enables building scalable, secure enterprise apps, that can be deployed anywhere. Using APEX, developers can quickly develop and deploy apps that solve real problems and provide immediate value.
Oracle database is a ```Relational Database Management System``` (RDBMS) similar to ```MySQL``` which is also owned by Oracle. Oracle database can be utilized for applications with large scale data and relational operations. It offers cloud based application development for free. Since ```Oracle APEX``` is a low code development platform, an existing knowledge of ```HTML```, ```CSS```, ```Javascript``` and ```MySQL``` is required to build full fledged applications.

The ```Logistic Management Information System```(LMIS) is being developed with ```Oracle APEX```.

## 1.2 Inventory Management System: a prototype of LMIS

Before developing a full fledged LMIS, an __Inventory Management System__ is created based on previous __Pharmacy Inventory Mobile Application__ developed by EHSSG.

<img src="images/wireframe.png" style="zoom:50%;" />
_Image:The Wireframe of Inventory Management System_

### 1.2.1 Application Users

Rather than opened to public registration, the __Inventory Management Application__ could only be logged in with a provided ```Username``` and ```Password```. The ```Username``` is going to be permanently registered with the warehouse name and not likely to be edited. Each user account will be provided with a set up __Warehouse Profile__ which values can be edited later. The __Warehouse Profile__ contains an ```In Charge``` field which can be updated anytime with the name of the person managing the warehouse.



### 1.2.2 Landing Page and the Main Menu

The landing page or the home page of the application is a welcome page to see first once the user has logged in. The landing page is populated with the __Query Interface__ where existing inventory information is going to be displayed in charts, graphs and tables.

The Main Menu is populated with __Submit Interface__ where inventory information is submitted though different pages.

#### 1.2.2 (a) Query Interface

##### My Inventory
> __My Inventory__ page is populated with query information on inventory data of the warehouse linked to the user. The page is displayed in ```Cards``` Layout showing ```Item```, ```Category``` and ```Amount``` which can be filtered with __Search__, __Category__ and __Source__ (Donor). Filtered views for items with a defined __minimal stock amount__ and items closing to a defined __expiry date__ are likely to be created if required.

##### __Individual Balance__
> When a card populated with ```Item```, ```Category``` and ```Amount``` is clicked, the application will redirect the user to the _detail_ page of each ```Item``` where different inventory information on the same ```Item``` with different ```Batch Number```, ```Expiry Date``` and ```Source``` are displayed. The incoming and outgoing stock records will also be displayed in list view.

##### __Child Inventory__
> This page works the same as __My Inventory__ page but displays the inventory information of child warehouses. The database administrator of the __Inventory Management Application__ will manually define the hierarchy.

##### __All Stock Records__
> ```Stock In```, ```Stock Out```, ```Expired```, ```Damaged``` information for the current warehouse will be displayed in __All Stock Records__ page sorting with ```Date``` of the record. Like other report pages, the result can be filtered with __Category__, __Search__, and __Source__ (Donor).

##### Requests from Children
> The page displays information listing __Request Forms__ from child warehouses sorted with __Requested Date__. After clicking individual requests, it will be redirected to a detail page of the __Request Form__ including ```Requested Medicine``` and ```Average Monthly Consumption```.

##### Expiry Alert
> The __Main Menu__ of the application will show a notification icon and upon clicking, display a modal dialog page listing notifications. The __Expiry Alert Page__ is going to be redirected after clicking the expiry alert notification. The notification date to the impending expiry can be defined manually.

##### Maps of Children
> For statistical and management infromation, Geolocation of the service is necessary. Security concerns, however, prohibit disclosing the geolocation of the warehouses. The __Map of Children__ page is going to show a map locating warehouses along the border as much information available.

#### 1.2.2 (b) Submit Interface

##### Add Stock Records
> All types of stock records can be filled in this page. ```Stock In```, ```Stock Out```, ```Expired```, ```Damage``` information can be selected from a Dropdown menu.
> From __Manage Category__ page, the user can add or remove __Category__ of the item.
> __Manage Item__ page allows the user to add or remove an __Item__ to or from the list populating the Item Dropdown menu.
> __Manage Package Form__ lets the user to edit __Package Form__ list where __Package Form__ Dropdown menu loads its data.
> __Manage Donor__ page is where the user can edit the list of donors.
> At__Manage Destination__ page, the user can edit the delivery destination of each item.

##### Request Forms
> Only child warehouses can submit request forms. This information is not only for statistical purposes, the requested data is automatically delivered to the respective parent warehouse.

##### Manage Warehouse Profile
> Any changes to the data collecting person such as __Name__, __Location__, __Geolocation__ can be edited in this page.

#### 1.2.3 Data Ownership
__EHSSG__ may have access to the Database during initial set up and technical support period. Once the data collecting persons and database administrators, after proper and thorough training, are able to operate independently, the ownership of the copy of the __Inventory Management Application__ and the __Database__ will be provided to individual organizations.
The information from the Database can be backed up by downloading, printing and sending to Email.

## 1.3 Moodle Learning Management System

Introduction to Moodle LMS was described in the previous report. **Moodle** is an online Learning Management System (LMS) that can be installed in moodlecloud or private websites.

# 5.0 Glossary
[^1]: Videos usually take a large amount of storage space in a web hosting. Most web hosting services are subscribed to premium hosting plans but it is a good practice to host photos and videos in another third party services in case of primary hosting server failure or an unexpected subscription cancels.
