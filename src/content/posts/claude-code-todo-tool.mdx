According to this [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1kt5yo5/claude_code_adding_use_a_todo_list_and_solve/), I have tried the same prompt suggested by user BlastNastier.

And this is the output. As you can see in this system prompt, you can directly call TodoWrite and TodoRead tools in Claude Code.

Claude Code's Todo Management System: Complete Guide

  Overview

  The Todo Management System in Claude Code is a built-in task tracking feature that helps maintain organization, demonstrate
  progress transparency, and ensure thorough completion of complex development tasks.

  Core Components

  1. TodoWrite Tool

  - Purpose: Create, update, and manage todo items
  - Parameters: Array of todo objects with required fields:
    - content: Task description (string, min 1 character)
    - status: Current state ("pending", "in_progress", "completed")
    - priority: Importance level ("high", "medium", "low")
    - id: Unique identifier (string)

  2. TodoRead Tool

  - Purpose: View current todo list status
  - Parameters: None (leave completely blank)
  - Usage: Proactive checking throughout conversations

  When to Use Todo Management

  ✅ Required Scenarios

  1. Complex multi-step tasks (3+ distinct steps)
  2. Non-trivial and complex tasks requiring careful planning
  3. User explicitly requests todo list usage
  4. Multiple tasks provided by user (numbered/comma-separated lists)
  5. After receiving new instructions - immediately capture requirements
  6. Before starting work - mark tasks as in_progress
  7. After completing tasks - mark as completed and add follow-ups

  ❌ Skip Todo Management When

  1. Single, straightforward task
  2. Trivial tasks requiring <3 steps
  3. Purely conversational/informational requests
  4. Tasks completable in one action

  Workflow Best Practices

  Task Creation Process

  1. Analyze user request
  2. Break down into specific, actionable items
  3. Use TodoWrite to create pending tasks
  4. Start with first high-priority item

  Active Task Management

  1. Mark ONE task as in_progress before starting
  2. Complete current task fully before moving to next
  3. Mark completed IMMEDIATELY after finishing
  4. Update status in real-time as you work
  5. Add new tasks if discovered during implementation

  Task Completion Requirements

  ONLY mark completed when:
  - Task is FULLY accomplished
  - No errors or blockers remain
  - Tests are passing (if applicable)
  - Implementation is complete

  Keep as in_progress if:
  - Tests are failing
  - Implementation is partial
  - Unresolved errors exist
  - Dependencies are missing

  Task States Management

  State Definitions

  - pending: Not yet started
  - in_progress: Currently working (LIMIT: ONE at a time)
  - completed: Successfully finished

  State Transition Rules

  1. pending → in_progress: When starting work
  2. in_progress → completed: When fully finished
  3. in_progress → pending: If need to pause/reprioritize
  4. Remove entirely: If task becomes irrelevant

  Proactive Usage Patterns

  Frequent Check Points

  - Beginning of conversations
  - Before starting new tasks
  - When uncertain about next steps
  - After completing tasks
  - Every few messages to ensure on track

  TodoRead Usage

  // Correct - leave completely blank
  TodoRead()

  // Incorrect - don't add dummy parameters
  TodoRead({"input": ""})  // ❌
  TodoRead({})             // ❌

  Task Writing Best Practices

  Content Guidelines

  - Specific and actionable: "Create login component" not "Work on authentication"
  - Clear scope: Define what "done" means
  - Technology specific: Include relevant framework/language details
  - User-focused: Reference user requirements directly

  Priority Assignment

  - High: Critical path items, user-blocking issues
  - Medium: Important but not blocking
  - Low: Nice-to-have, optimization tasks

  ID Management

  - Use simple incrementing numbers: "1", "2", "3"
  - Keep consistent throughout conversation
  - Don't reuse IDs from deleted tasks

  Integration with Development Workflow

  Planning Phase

  1. Receive user requirements
  2. Use TodoWrite to capture all tasks
  3. Prioritize based on dependencies
  4. Start with foundational tasks first

  Implementation Phase

  1. Mark current task in_progress
  2. Implement solution
  3. Test/verify functionality
  4. Mark completed immediately
  5. Move to next priority task

  Error Handling

  1. Keep task in_progress if errors occur
  2. Create new task for error resolution
  3. Don't mark original as completed until fixed
  4. Update task content if scope changes

  Communication Benefits

  For Users

  - Transparency: Clear view of progress
  - Confidence: Systematic approach visible
  - Planning: Understanding of remaining work
  - Tracking: Historical record of completed work

  For Claude

  - Organization: Structured approach to complex tasks
  - Memory: Track progress across conversation
  - Completeness: Ensure nothing is forgotten
  - Quality: Systematic verification of work

  Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

  ❌ Don't Do This

  - Batch multiple completions together
  - Mark tasks completed prematurely
  - Use vague task descriptions
  - Have multiple in_progress tasks
  - Forget to update status during work
  - Create todos for trivial single-step tasks

  ✅ Do This Instead

  - Complete tasks one at a time
  - Mark completed only when fully done
  - Write specific, actionable descriptions
  - Maintain single in_progress task
  - Update status in real-time
  - Reserve todos for complex, multi-step work

  Example Workflows

  Web Development Project

  User: "Add dark mode to my React app"

  Assistant creates todos:
  1. [pending] Analyze current theme structure
  2. [pending] Create theme context and provider
  3. [pending] Implement dark mode CSS variables
  4. [pending] Add theme toggle component
  5. [pending] Update existing components for theme support
  6. [pending] Test functionality and fix issues

  Then proceeds systematically through each task.

  Bug Fix Scenario

  User: "The login form isn't working"

  Assistant creates todos:
  1. [pending] Investigate login form issue
  2. [pending] Identify root cause
  3. [pending] Fix authentication logic
  4. [pending] Test login functionality
  5. [pending] Verify edge cases

  Updates status as work progresses.

  This system ensures thorough, organized, and transparent development work while maintaining clear communication with users
  about progress and next steps.
